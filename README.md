# libp2p-exchange-rendezvous

Data Exchange component that uses other peers to exchange requests/responses

## Use-Case

The use case for this exchange component is to allow exchanges between two peers that are not directly connected but share one or more rendezvous peers.

## WIP

> Everything WIP. Tests WIP too so I have no idea if it works.
